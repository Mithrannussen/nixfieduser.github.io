It is my first time writing a more technical blog, previously I maintained during a few months a Blogger account and wrote about mathematics and general study guides but nothing highly complex given that I was in high school and had very limited writing skills.


Another factor that motivated me in trying this new activity is the need to improve my knowledge and overall abilities with the English language. Being more active, creating something in another language is something that I've never systematically attempt even though I was aware of it being one of the requirements in order to gain a higher proficiency, but only now I am actively engaging with it, at least with the written aspect of the language.

However, the most important reason of starting this blog might be the current undergrad program I'm in, and given the fact that most professionals in the field of programming and computer sciences have a very sophisticated portfolio, website/blog and obviously, a GitHub profile, it felt as something needed and ignored for too long.

I intent to write most about opensource, NixOS and related programming themes but I won't force myself into any predefined category, maybe in the near future I will be able to provide a better description of my main objectives in here.

But for now,

I appreciate your time reading this welcome message!

Flavio.
